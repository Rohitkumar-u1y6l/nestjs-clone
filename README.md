<h1 align="center">NestJS Clone</h1>

<p align="center">A clone of the popular <b>NodeJS</b> framework <a href="https://nestjs.com"><b>NestJS</b></a>, built using TypeScript.</p>

### Motivation

The motivation behind building this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of NestJS, one of
the most popular Node.js frameworks. By creating a clone of NestJS, I want to explore its core concepts, such as
decorators, dependency injection, middleware, pipes, guards, interceptors, and exception filters. This hands-on approach
will provide valuable insights into how NestJS is built and how it can be leveraged to develop robust and scalable
applications. Through this project, I aim to enhance my knowledge and skills in TypeScript and Node.js development,
ultimately becoming more proficient in building modern web applications.

### Description

This repository is created to build a clone of the popular Node.js framework NestJS to understand its working and how it
is built. The project is created using TypeScript and Node.js.
