## Introduction

Welcome to the **NestFactory Example Application**. This project is a demonstration of building a scalable and modular
application framework using TypeScript and Node.js, inspired by the NestJS framework. It serves as an educational
example to understand core principles of application architecture, including dependency injection, modular design, and
request handling.

## Overview

The **NestFactory Example Application** is designed to showcase how to structure a Node.js application with a focus on
modularity and separation of concerns. The project includes several key components and concepts that are crucial for
developing robust and maintainable software systems.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: The application is organized into modules, each responsible for a distinct part of the
  system. Modules (`AppModule`, `ExampleModule`) encapsulate related components, services, and configurations, promoting
  code reusability and easier maintenance.

- **Dependency Injection**: By using decorators and a custom dependency injection mechanism, the project demonstrates
  how to manage dependencies efficiently. This approach helps in reducing tight coupling between components and
  facilitates easier testing and development.

- **Custom Framework**: The `NestFactory` class is the heart of the application, handling the creation and
  initialization of the application environment. It registers modules, resolves dependencies, and starts the HTTP
  server.

## Components

- **Modules**: Modules define the application’s structure by grouping related components and services. The `@Module`
  decorator configures module metadata, such as imports, providers, and exports, organizing the application into logical
  units.

- **Controllers**: Controllers are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests. They interact with services to
  perform necessary operations and return responses to the client. The `@Controller` decorator marks a class as a
  controller and defines its routes.

- **Services**: Services contain the business logic and provide methods for the application's operations. Services are
  injected into controllers and other services using the `@Injectable` decorator. Examples include `AppService`
  and `LoggerService`.

- **Decorators**: Decorators are used to define and manage the roles of classes within the application.
  The `@Module`, `@Injectable`, and `@Controller` decorators provide metadata that helps in configuring and resolving
  dependencies.

## How It Works

1. **Application Bootstrapping**: The `NestFactory` class is used to create and configure the application. It
   initializes the `NestContainer`, registers the root module (`AppModule`), and sets up the application environment.

2. **Module Registration**: During the bootstrapping process, `NestFactory` registers modules and their dependencies
   with the `NestContainer`. This includes adding providers, resolving dependencies, and setting up the application
   context.

3. **Dependency Resolution**: The `NestContainer` manages the lifecycle of services and their dependencies. It resolves
   dependencies by creating instances of providers and injecting them into controllers and other services.

4. **Request Handling**: When the application receives an HTTP request, the appropriate controller processes the
   request, interacts with services to perform operations, and generates a response. The controller uses services
   like `AppService` to handle business logic.

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: The modular design allows for easy expansion and maintenance of the application. New features can be
  added by creating new modules without disrupting existing code.

- **Maintainability**: Separation of concerns and dependency injection promote a clean and organized codebase. Each
  component has a well-defined responsibility, making it easier to manage and test.

- **Flexibility**: The use of decorators and a custom framework provides flexibility in configuring and managing
  application components. This approach allows for a high degree of customization and control over the application’s
  behavior.

This project is a valuable resource for understanding the principles of application design and provides a solid
foundation for building scalable and maintainable Node.js applications.
