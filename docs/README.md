<h1 style="text-align: center;">NestJS Clone</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  A clone of the popular <b>NodeJS</b> framework <a href="https://nestjs.com"><b>NestJS</b></a>, built using TypeScript.
</p>

### Motivation

The motivation behind building this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of NestJS, one of
the most popular Node.js frameworks. By creating a clone of NestJS, I want to explore its core concepts, such as
Dependency Injection, Decorators and others as well as the architectural patterns and design principles that underpin
its framework. This hands-on approach
will provide valuable insights into how NestJS is built and how it can be leveraged to develop robust and scalable
applications.

### Description

This repository is created to build a clone of the popular Node.js framework NestJS to understand its working and how it
is built. The project is created using TypeScript and Node.js.
